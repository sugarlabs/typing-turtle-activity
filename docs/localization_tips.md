### Localizing Typing Turtle

As with any other Sugar activity, Typing Turtle is translated using [Pootle](translate.sugarlabs.org).  Pootle displays the translatable strings from the newest version of the activity and allows them to be translated into a different language.  When translations are saved, the author is notified and will then release a new version to activities.sugarlabs.org with the new translations.  

Typing Turtle's lesson content is too complex to be translated the same way, and must be created from scratch for each language and keyboard layout.  Use the lesson editor feature to create a new set of lessons for your language and keyboard layout, export the lessons to the Journal, and email them to the author.  They will be included in the next version.
